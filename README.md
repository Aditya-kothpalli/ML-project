### Introduction
Iris flowers are different from the species that are grown naturally. These flowers named “iris” by greeks as it means that the Greek goddess brings good along with the seasons by passing through the rainbow from heaven to earth. These flowers have many usages in these days. They are have been used for medical and cosmetical purposes. Besides being a common fragrance added to perfumes, the juice from fresh iris roots was used to remove freckles. The root was blended to create cough syrups and topical treatments for skin conditions like eczema and acne. The seeds were prescribed for digestive problems. With the rise of aromatherapy, the oil from irises is said to help with congestion and boosting mood. ML may generalize the effort or method to formulate the policy. These ML models can be learned by themselves. The model is trained on Iris Flower. The model can then accurately predict quality by using the necessary elements as inputs. This decreases human effort and resources and improves the company's profitability. Thus, the accuracy can be improved with ML. Our goal is to predict the exact iris flowers. Classification is the best choice available to fulfill our needs. We use classification models in this analysis since there are many independent variables used to calculate the dependent(target) variable. For this study, the dataset for quality prediction is used.
